      <p id="pOne">
        Hey, I'm Hayden Orr, and I originally grew up in Northwest, but I've
        lived in Rochester for the last five years. I'm currently in Applied
        Computer Technology, but I'm hoping to eventually transfer into Software
        Engineering (with my focus on Computer Security) or Computer Security
        once I've completed all necessary math credits required. I'm a total
        InfoSec geek.
      </p>

        I used to work at NTID in their Theatre department, so RIT's already
        like a second home to me. I'm so thankful for the opportunity to be back
        here on campus and a chance to take classes here. Last week has been so
        fun, and I look forward to experiencing many more weeks like this for
        the next few years.

        The experience of building this website can be described as ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly really rewarding. I've struggled and learned so much. I've
        never thought I would enjoy the front-end and designing a site. But
        creating this website has been so fun, and I've learned so much,
        especially from all of my mistakes and feedback from my teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm so proud of the color scheme I've chosen for my site because I've
        never felt confident about my ability with visual design or any visual
        art. However, I thought I did well matching the vibe of Dungeons and
        Dragons. I'm also pleased that I get to work on something useful for my
        audience. There are barely any resources about signing various terms in
        D&D. I would want to keep updating and working on this website as I
        collect more resources for the Deaf community. Making this website
        responsive was probably the most challenging part of this project, so
        I'm proud of how hard I worked on that.
